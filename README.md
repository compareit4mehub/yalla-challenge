# Full Stack Developer Challenge


## COMPLETED AS PER REQUIREMENTS
Application is built using Grails, a MVC framework for Groovy, a JVM based language.

It is a part of Full Stack developer challenge by Yalla Compare, UAE's leading insurance comparing company. 

To use:
Enter a Github Username and hit submit
User data is first looked up in local cache/database. If it exists, then we'll simply render the data to frontend.
If nothing was found, the app consumes the Github API to fetch user data. Data is trimmed and required fields are saved in local database.
Then this data is rendered on frontend.
Data includes Github ID, Username, Profile Photo, Location and number of public Repositories.
