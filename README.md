Starting with the main page at `/` you'll get a button that takes you to the github account page.

The page can be accessed by either `/github` or by `/gitUser/getUser`.

You can then fill the form to get the user's information.

You can also fill the form by `GET`, specifying the username field, or by accessing `/github/<username>`.

You can also get a json response from the endpoint by `GET` with `Accept` type `application/json` on `/gitUser/getUser` or by accessing `/gitUser/getUser.json`


*Note: Default port used which is 8080*
