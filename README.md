# Full Stack Developer Assignment


## COMPLETED AS PER REQUIREMENTS
After submitting an account name, it is first searched in Database.

If there is no data available for that user, then data is obtained by github API.

Intentionally left the Repository details as the Requirement stated 'THE Number of Public Repos', nothing was mentioned about getting details as well. 

So I assumed it is not necessary to make another API Call for this purpose.

Will be done in couple of minutes if asked though.

Just for reference, following API endpoint would be used for this.

"https://api.github.com/users/targetUser/repos"
